## React Sateless Component inherits from Stateful Component 

### React programming pattern

* A stateful component class defines a function that calls this.setState. (App.js, lines 15-19)
* The stateful component passes that function down to a stateless component. (App.js, line 24)
* That stateless component class defines a function that calls the passed-down function, and that can take an event object as an argument. (Child.js, lines 10-13)
* The stateless component class uses this new function as an event handler. (Child.js, line 20)
* When an event is detected, the Appâ€™s state updates. (A user selects a new dropdown menu item)
* The stateful component class passes down its state, distinct from the ability to change its state, to a different stateless component. (App.js, line 25)
* That stateless component class receives the state and displays it. (Sibling.js, lines 5-10)
* An instance of the stateful component class is rendered. One stateless child component displays the state, and a different stateless child component displays a way to change the state. (App.js, lines 23-26)
